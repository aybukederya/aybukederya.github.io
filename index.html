	<p>I am a freshman studying computer science at McGill University. You can learn more about my personal computer science projects <a class = "in-text-link" href = "projects.html"> here</a>. </p>
		
	<p>I am also really into literature, so <a class = "in-text-link" href = "literature.html"> here</a>  are some of my poems and reviews.</p>
	
	<hr> <p> More about me: I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. I am currently living in Istanbul. In my free time, I play the cello. I always try to set time aside for various volunteering projects. In high school, I organized and led a science camp for middle school children, teaching them the basics of programming using Scratch and Makey Makey. I learned a lot during these two weeks, and have been further inspired to study computer science. </p>
