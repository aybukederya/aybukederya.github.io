		<br> I am a freshman studying computer science and mathematics at McGill University. You can learn more about my personal computer science projects <a href = "projects.html"> here. </a> 
		
		<br> I am also really into literature, so <a href = "literature.html"> here </a>  are some poems.
		
		<br> 
		<br> Spoiler: Some of my personal projects are also highly related to literature so check them out if interested!
